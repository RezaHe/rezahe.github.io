2. Run the project: `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
The page will reload if you make edits.

## 📁 Folder structure

-   `/public`: publicly accessible contents (ex: images, media).
-   `/src`: all the components used in this project.
    -   `/src/components/`: each reusable components of each pages.
    -   `/src/data`: configurations of the web app.
    -   `/src/pages`: pages that include in the web app.

## ⚙️ Configurations

Since this is a public and open source project, you can make any changes to it. If you are a ReactJS developer you can do it easily. But if you are a beginner, I have extracted the configurable data into a single directory, so you can edit the files in that directory to configure the entire web application.

Directory: `/src/data/`

-   `user.js`

    From this you can change the content of each page of the web application.

-   `articles.js`

    From this you can add your articles to the web application.

    Instructions:

    -   Add new article

        1. Create a new function starts with `article_`. For example you can add new function named `article_3`.

        2. Then add the data accordingly.

            - Add `<React.Fragment>` tag and it's closing tags in body.
            - In React there has no keyword `class`, so you should use `className` to define html classes.

            ```js
            function article_3() {
            	return {
            		date: "7 May 2023",
            		title: "The Benefits of Cloud Computing",
            		description: "Why businesses are turning to the cloud.",
            		style: `
            				.random-image {
            					align-self: center;
            					outline: 2px solid red;
            				}
            				`,
            		body: (
            			<React.Fragment>
            				<div className="article-content">
            					<div className="paragraph">
            						Content of article 1
            					</div>
            					<img
            						src="https://picsum.photos/200/300"
            						alt="random"
            						className="random-image"
            					/>
            				</div>
            			</React.Fragment>
            		),
            	};
            }
            ```

        3. In the last lines you will see an array to which you need to add your new `articles` function.

            ```js
            const myArticles = [article_1, article_2, article_3];
            ```

-   `styles.css`

    From this you can change the font colors and font families of the web application.

        ```css
        :root {
        	/* ------- colors ------- */
        	--primary-color: #27272a;
        	--secondary-color: #65656d;
        	--tertiary-color: #acacb4;
        	--quaternary-color: #e4e4e7;
        	--link-color: #14b8a6;
        	/* ---------------------- */

        	/* ------- fonts ------- */
        	--primary-font: "Heebo", sans-serif;
        	--secondary-font: "Roboto", sans-serif;
        	/* --------------------- */
        }
        ```

## 🚀 Building the React App

To build the React app, you can use the `npm run build` command. This will create a production-ready build of your app in the `build/` directory.

Here are the steps to follow:

1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the root directory of your React app.
2. Run the `npm run build` command to create a production build of your app. This will generate a static bundle of your app in the `build/` directory.
3. Copy the contents of the `build/` directory to your server's public directory. You can do this using an FTP client or by running a command like `scp` to transfer the files to your server. Make sure to replace `example.com` and `/var/www/html` with your server's domain name and public directory, respectively:

    ```bash
    scp -r build/* user@example.com:/var/www/html
    ```

4. Your portfolio app should now be accessible from your server's domain name. You can verify this by opening a web browser and navigating to http://example.com (replace example.com with your server's domain name).

That's it! Your React portfolio app should now be up and running on your server. Note that you may need to configure your server's web server (e.g., Apache or Nginx) to serve the index.html file in the build/ directory as the default page for your domain.
